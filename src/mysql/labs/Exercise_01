 *          a. id (auto increment)
 *          b. first_name
 *          c. age
 *

 *
 *      5.) Create the appropriate foreign key constraints in the "teachers_students" table. - done
 *
 *      6.) Populate each table with at least 5 records. Use the "teachers_students" to associate various

 *
 *      7.) Write queries (and paste them below) for each of the following tasks: -done
 *          a. select all students
               SELECT * FROM university.students;

 *          b. select all teacher who teach "Math" (choose a subject you included) - done
                SELECT * FROM university.teachers WHERE subject = "Maths";

 *          c. use a join query to select all students with a certain teacher - done
                SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, t.first_name, t.last_name
                FROM students s
                INNER JOIN teachers_students ts
                     ON s.id = ts.student_id
                INNER JOIN teachers t
                	 ON t.id = ts.teacher_id
                WHERE t.last_name = "Smith";

 *          d. use a join query to select all students with taking a certain subject - done
                SELECT s.first_name, s.last_name, c.name
                FROM students s
                INNER JOIN students_courses sc
                     ON s.id = sc.student_id
                INNER JOIN courses c
                	 ON c.id = sc.course_id
                WHERE c.name = "Math";

 *          e. update a record in the student table - done
                 SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;
                 UPDATE university.courses
                 SET name = "MathPhysics"
                 WHERE name = "physics";

 *          f. add a record to the teacher table - done
                 INSERT INTO university.students
                    (first_name, last_name, email)
                 VALUES
                    ("Tim", "Wood", "tim@codingnomads.co");
